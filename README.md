# Sample Code
## Biometry Course Content
These files are samples of R code from a master's level Biometry class at Virginia Tech. 

Biometry is statistics applied to biological data. This course centered around bolstering students currently engaged with biological research with greater statistical rigor. Apart from coding various statistical tools in R, the bulk of the course content was engaging in literature reviews. 

Namely, Are we acquainted with the statistical standards in our industry? Can we spot faulty tests/results when scanning an article? Can we avoid these same pitfalls in our own research? How do we design a robust, reproducible experiment? 

## Repo Content: Assignments
You will find various assignments that I find most illustrative of the course content. Coupled with all of these assignements were various industry articles pertaining to the corresponding statistical topic.

* *Assignment_anova_checking_assumptions.R* is code from an assignment aimed at working with contrasts and the package emmeans. 
* *Assignment_anova_assumptions_knitted.pdf* is the knitted file as a pdf. 

* *Burris_midterm.R* is the code from the midterm assignment aimed at designing and implementing an experiment. 
* *Burris_midterm_knitted.pdf* is the knitted file as a pdf.

* *Assignment_clustering.R* analyses various clustering methods
* *Assignment_clustering_knitted.docx* is the knitted .R file as a word document.
